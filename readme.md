This repository started as an "open notebook" of my experimentation and learning with Apple technology. It is basically a way to demonstrate the use of  Core ML, a framework that makes running various machine learning and statistical models on macOS and iOS natively supported. The idea is that the framework helps data scientists and developers bridge the gap between them by integrating trained models into our apps.

The original code was showcased as a series of posts in my website [here](https://jrogel.com/core-ml-preparing-environment/). Please note that since the original publication of these posts, the dataset used in the example has been phased out as the machine learning community has developed awareness about fairness issues. I am redoing the repo with using the California Housing dataset instead. 

Swift and Xcode have changed quite substantially so I am also taking an opportunity to update the app in this repo using SwiftUI. The steps are  covered in my book [Advaced Data Science and Analytics with Python](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Advanced-Science-Analytics-Knowledge-Discovery-ebook/dp/B0883XB13B?ref_=ast_author_dp_rw&th=1&psc=1&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.DUjLlJmyIrkTRPfNk6I82PakpJ3Lv1wZs9WwoU9bZiOvxredensqG2aSbjdxWuo7pfjs1XsXDLSA1abhEq16i3i_kl0C8xTA-HBy0KLcPMo.tas9N6OAYQbsDTWjpDh6sCASpj8RcltpeKH91FkB1GQ&dib_tag=AUTHOR) in particular the 2nd eidion available from 2026. The book is the companion to [Data Science and Analytics with Python](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Science-Analytics-Chapman-Knowledge-Discovery-ebook/dp/B0FC5R9XLB?ref_=ast_author_mpb) (2st Edition) published with Chapman & Hall/CRC. The new book is coming out in early 2020. 

Sounds cool, don't you think? I would love to hear what you think.
